# About The Project
Ever since the 70's game companies, big and small, have been producing games to keep the public entertained. These game range from sports titles to open world exploring games, all to meet the publics needs. Our group sought out sales data for video games to see what games are the most profitable, and what kind of games thrive best in different areas of the world.
<br>
With these goals in mind our team set out to gather data, storing it in an SQL database, and host it on a python server, visulizing it through the browser using JavaScript D3.
